# [About the Discord bot](#about-the-discord-bot)
The bot is running on **Discord.js Library** and was developed using **JavaScript** programming language. \
It has various different commands, but the main attraction of the bot is its Action commands (hug, pat, kiss etc). \
The bot is mostly anime-themed, but it can also be used by anyone, it doesn't have to be just for weebs. \
What sets this bot out amongst countless other bots is its **[Mention System](#mention-system)**.

## [Who is it based on?](#who-is-it-based-on)
[Milim Nava](https://tensura.fandom.com/wiki/Milim_Nava) is a support character from [Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken (TenSura)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37430/Tensei_shitara_Slime_Datta_Ken).

Since the most kawaii theme right now is Anime related Discord bots, I decided to choose her as mine. \
She is also currently in season and I've barely seen any bots resolving around her. 

## [Features](#features)
### The bot currently has:
- 25+ Action commands (Hug, kiss, pat etc) with more being added over time!
- Powerful and advanced [Mention System](#mention-system-30)
- Pagination (React with the emojis for next/back)
- A database that handles everything from server list cache to bot updates and more.
- Custom Server Prefix and Description
- Server Modules that can be turned on/off
- Marriage. Do keep in mind that this is not real and bots are not marriageable! uwu
- Role Hierarchy (VIP, Premium, Developer etc)
- Classical prediction commands and a few custom ones (i.e like, love and pick)
- Waifurate and Husbandorate
- Kitsu.io and MyAnimeList database Anime OR Manga search (with random suggestions!)
- Detailed serverinfo with Server Description, Server Avatar and Splash Invite Screen (Direct links for 32 and up to 2048 size image)
- Detailed statistic command (total + daily command usage, cached users, bot groups, ping, RAM usage, bot version and more)

...And so much more!

## [Mention System 3.0](#mention-system-30)
### What is a Mention System?
A Mention System is a system that will help find a user with various methods and with advanced algorithms. \
For the common developer or someone who don't really need a fancy system, they more or less just use a `user ID` or a `@Mention` as their only options. \
However, I decided to expand my horizon and follow the bigger fish and then improve it to go even further beyond the limits.

### What are the benefits of this system?
*You can silently find a global Discord or local Server user and then use them in any command with this system.* \
*This is all without having to worry about `@pinging` them like most bots utilize nowadays.* \
*Because we all have that one person who ALWAYS hate `@Mentions`, right?* \
*And let's all be real, who would sit for 3 hours listening to the kid ranting that you pinged them over and over again in commands...* \
*Because I don't and that's why this system came into the lights and because I hate being an nuisance to others if I can help it.*

### From a tiny hobby project to an advanced system
With its powerful and advanced, yet enriching `Mention System` it can be on par or even rival bigger bots with ease. \
First it was just a tiny hobby project for me to toy around with, which was barely enough to put most bots off the chart. Furthermore, developing it into V.2 enhanced it even a step further and it got even more powerful with its newely added global user support. \
With the latest version, being 3.0 released, it now features even server role users support, which revolutionized it.

### If this is not enough to satisfy the most average Discord user, I'll fall from grace, literally.

See below for everything the new and powerful `Mention System 3.0` recently released can do! \
There are several ways to find a user and use them in commands silently!
### Finding a Discord user on your server:
- Server nickname
- Discord username (i.e Username or Username#1234) 
- Descriminator (I.e #1234 or 1234)
- User ID (I.e 209972381622468604)
- Mention (I.e @Username)

### `[New]` Find a user or multiple user(s) on your server with a role:
**Note:** The user in the role mentioned/found would have to be cached beforehand! \
This means that if no user in that role has been cached yet, it will return as empty.
- Role tag (i.e @CoolestGroup or <@&396819590266486784>)
- Role ID (i.e 396819590266486784)
- Role name (i.e Developer)

### Finding a global user & use them later on:
- User ID
**Note:** Once the user is cached, they can easily be mentioned in other servers [Example](https://i.imgur.com/5D0lgIU.gif) with the following methods:
- Discord username (i.e Username or Username#1234) 
- User ID (I.e 209972381622468604)
- Descriminator (I.e #1234 or 1234)

### Caching and what it does:
Once a Discord user is active (i.e sends a message) on a server and a channel the bot has access to, it will automatically cache that user and store the user until the next bot restart. This bot's mention system is using this cache by searching through it using advanced algorithms to find a specific user and to make sure that **8 out of 10** times it finds the correct user. There are also ways to manually cache users (mainly by tagging them with a `@mention`) or by using their `Discord ID` on any of the available commands using this system.

## [F.A.Q](#faq)
*Here is a short FAQ with the most common questions one mostly asks about.*

### Main purpose of the Discord bot
Milim aims for the "best" action bot on the discord bot market. And its main purpose is to produce anime action commands and have the most powerful and advanced mention system there is.

### Unique about the Mention System?
It allows a user to go beyond that of what most bots offers to them with mentioning. A Discord ID or @Mention is fine as is, but it felt like a pain after a while. Therefore I coded my own system that allows one to find global discord users with ID, local users with username, nickname, descrimnator and more.

### What are all of Discord bot's features?
Everything is listed in in [Features](#features)

### Do the bot have any premium content? Can I support the project?
The Discord bot currently are 100% free and has no limitations with premium perks. But the system is in place and it may become active in the future.
As for supporting it, any donations are welcome. Feel free to PM **Kuuko#0001** on Discord for further details.

### How often is there updates?
This is a hobby project and a learning ground for me since 2019, with continues updates almost weekly. However as of lately (2021), I've taken a step back and become less active in the project. But I am still around to patch bugs and at times dedicate myself fully to the project.

### Where can I find the website for Milim?
