# About Tsumiki
Tsumiki is a Discord bot running on **Discord.js Library** and was developed using **JavaScript** programming language. \
The bot features various Commands, such as Action Commands, Utilities, Fun Commands, Predictions and more! \
Tsumiki's Commands should feel like they want to be used over and over again, because of it's quality and layout. \
But with the main focus on the design and the functionality, as well as Paginating some of them wherever it fits. \
Commands such as Action Commands (Hug, kiss, nuzzle etc) often tends to be static and only contain one line or a static response, even if you have multiple mentions, and things like that is what I want to focus on changing for my bot.

## Who are Tsumiki based off?
[Tsumiki Miniwa](https://acchikocchi.fandom.com/wiki/Tsumiki_Miniwa) is the main character from [Acchi Kocchi (Place to Place)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12291/Acchi_Kocchi_TV).

Since the most kawaii theme right now is Anime related Discord bots, I decided to choose Tsumiki as mine. \
There is already a bot called [Tsumiki-bot](https://top.gg/bot/390347640438521856), but it seem to be outdated and possibly not being developed on anymore. \
So I stepped up my game with a new bot on the Discord bot market, which is not related with [Tsumiki-bot](https://top.gg/bot/390347640438521856) features.

## Tsumiki features:
**Tsumiki currently has:**
- 25+ Action commands (Hug, kiss, pat etc) with more being added over time!
- Powerful and advanced [Mention System](#mention-system)
- Pagination/[Discord Buttons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsumiki-buttons)
- A database that handles everything from server list cache to bot updates and more.
- Custom Server Prefix and Description
- Server Modules that can be turned on/off
- Marriage. Do keep in mind that this is not real and bots are not marriageable! uwu
- Role Hierarchy (VIP, Premium, Developer etc)
- Classical prediction commands and a few custom ones (i.e like, love and pick)
- Waifurate and Husbandorate
- Kitsu.io and MyAnimeList database Anime OR Manga search (with random suggestions!)
- Detailed serverinfo with Server Description, Server Avatar and Splash Invite Screen (Direct links for 32 and up to 2048 size image)
- Detailed statistic command (total + daily command usage, cached users, bot groups, ping, RAM usage, bot version and more)

...And so much more!

## Mention System
Tsumiki is no longer just your "average" bot. \
With a powerful, advanced and enriching Mention System that can be on par or even rival larger bots. \
This bot is no longer just your normal everyday bot. \
First it was Mention System V.1, which was enough to put most bots off the chart. \
Furthermore, developing it into V.2 enhanced it further and it got even more powerful with global user support. \
With the latest version, being 3.0 released, it now features Role Support, which is by no feat easily done.

See below for everything the new and powerful **Mention System 3.0** recently released can do!

There are several ways to find a user and use them in commands silently!
**Finding a Discord user on that server:**
- Server nickname
- Discord username (i.e Username or Username#1234) 
- Descriminator (I.e #1234 or 1234)
- User ID (I.e 209972381622468604)
- Mention (I.e @Username)

**[New] Find a user or multiple user(s) on that server with a role:** \
Note: The user in the role mentioned/found would have to be cached on beforehand! \
This means that if no user has spoken in that server since last bot restart, it wouldn't return any user(s).
- Role tag (i.e @CoolestGroup or <@&396819590266486784>)
- Role ID (i.e 396819590266486784)

**Finding a global user and use them for future:**
- User ID
**Note:** Once the user is cached, they can easily be mentioned in other servers [Example](https://i.imgur.com/5D0lgIU.gif) with the following methods:
- Discord username (i.e Username or Username#1234) 
- User ID (I.e 209972381622468604)
- Descriminator (I.e #1234 or 1234)
