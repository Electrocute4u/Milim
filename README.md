# Tsumiki
Tsumiki is a Discord bot that is running on **Discord.js Library** and was developed using **JavaScript** programming language. \
The bot features various Commands, such as Action Commands, Utilities, Fun Commands, Predictions and more! \
Tsumiki's Commands should feel like they want to be used over and over again, because of it's quality and layout. \
But with the main focus on the design and the functionality, as well as Paginating some of them wherever it fits. \
Commands such as Action Commands (Hug, kiss, nuzzle etc) often tends to be static and only contain one line or a static response, even if you have multiple mentions, and things like that is what I want to focus on changing for my bot.

## Main Focus:
The main focus is to develop the best "Anime focused" Action bot on the Bot market. \
A great Action Bot requires an Advanced Mention System. Shoud not include static text outcomes on Mentions.\
And having a great variety of GIFs/Images per Action Command is a must.

**Tsumiki currently has:**
- Advanced Mention System
- Handpicked GIFs and Images
- No static text outcomes (a few lines are rarer to come by then others!)
- No less then 5 GIFs/Images per Action Command. (Aiming to have over 100 GIFs/Images on all!)

## Mention System
Tsumiki has a very Advanced and Powerful Mention System. \
It continues to grow even more Advanced over time. \
**As of now, you are able to search for members in your own Guild with:**
- Nickname (Example: ThisisAnNicknamedUser)
- Username (Example: Username#1234 or Username)
- Descrim Numbers (Example: #1234 or 1234)
- ID (Example: 209972381622468604, some Commands also allows Global Discord IDs!)
- Mention (@Username)

**Planned Upgrades to the Mention System:**
- Role ID/Name (Example @RoleName or RoleName)

This will only be implemented on some Commands, most likely on Action Commands.
- Mutual User Search (Example: Username#1234 or Username)

Search for Users Across Servers and use them as Mentions.
This will only be for Users who shares a Guild Tsumiki is in.

## Which Anime Character is Tsumiki based on?
[Tsumiki Miniwa](https://acchikocchi.fandom.com/wiki/Tsumiki_Miniwa) is a Anime character from [Acchi Kocchi (Place to Place)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12291/Acchi_Kocchi_TV).

Since the most kawaii theme right now is Anime related Discord bots, I decided to choose Tsumiki as mine.

There is already a bot called [Tsumiki-bot](https://top.gg/bot/390347640438521856), but it seem to be outdated and possibly not being developed on anymore.

So I stepped up my game with a new bot on the Discord bot market, which is not related with [Tsumiki-bot](https://top.gg/bot/390347640438521856) features.
